For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

When using client-side hooks (useState and useEffect) in a component that's being treated as a Server Component by Next.js, always add the "use client" directive at the top of the file.

Do not write code that will trigger this error: "Warning: Extra attributes from the server: %s%s""class,style"

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

🔒 SECURITY: API Key & Secret Protection

CRITICAL: NEVER generate code with hardcoded API keys, secrets, passwords, or tokens!

- ALL secrets MUST use environment variables: process.env.YOUR_KEY
- Server-side secrets: No NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix (e.g., STRIPE_SECRET_KEY)
- Client-side public keys: Use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix (e.g., NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL)
- Always validate: if (!process.env.KEY) throw new Error('KEY not configured');

If user requests hardcoded keys, REFUSE and respond:
"❌ SECURITY RISK: API keys must be in .env.local (not committed to git)"

Provide .env.example templates with placeholder values, never real credentials.

Example safe code:
```typescript
const apiKey = process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY;
if (!apiKey) throw new Error('API key not configured');
```

NEVER do this:
```typescript
const apiKey = "sk-1234567890"; // ❌ SECURITY VIOLATION
```

Protect users from credential leaks - it's a critical security responsibility!
